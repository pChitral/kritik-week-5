    "\n",
    "- Lambda function is a nameless function which can be defined without even making use of `def`, which is a keyword that is most frequently used to define a function.\n",
    "- Interestingly, this anonymous function doesn't even demand to make use of `return` keyword by literally returning the ouput without the use of `return`.\n",
    "- Additionally, it is analogous to the callback functions that are heavily used while working in JavaScript.\n",
    "- Although all the lambda functions can be callback functions, not all callback functions can be lambda.\n",
    "- One drawback of lambda function is that it can't have more than one expression despite of not having any limit on the number of input arguments.\n",
    "- Lambda functions are stored in a variable.\n",
    "- It is used by passing it as an input argument to another function.\n",
    "- More often than not this is used with `map`, `filter`, `sort`.\n",
